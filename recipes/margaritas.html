    <h2>Blood Orange Margaritas</h2>
    <p>These <strong>Blood Orange and Grapefruit Margaritas</strong> will knock your socks off with how good tasting
        they are. Although they are not your typical tequila margarita they have been proven time after time to be the
        best tasting homemade margarita around. I learned this recipe from my father in-law and since my first sip I
        haven't found a margarita that can compete. The sweetness of the blood orange cuts through the citrus of the
        grapefruit and pairs nicely with <strong>Espolon Reposado</strong> tequila.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 blood orange</li>
        <li>1 grapefruit</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>2 ounces of Espolon Respado tequila (or any tequila of choice)</li>
        <li>1 ounce water</li>
        <li>splash of blue agave nectar</li>
        <li>ice</li>
        <li>salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First juice the blood orange, grapefruit, and limes and mix in a bowl or jug.</li>
        <li>Fill the shaker with ice and mix equal amounts of the juice mixture and tequila. I personally recommend 2
            ounces of each but sometimes I will do an extra ounce of tequila.</li>
        <li>Add the 1 ounce of water and a splash of blue agave nectar. The amount of agave can vary depending on how
            sweet or sour the blood oranges are.</li>
        <li>Mix everything in the shaker and then you have the option to rim the glass with salt. Pour mixture into
            prefered glass, add a wedge of lime, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
