This will be my first project on the Odin Project. I am taking the Colt Steele course on Udemy at the same time and am using the odin project to build a list of things that I have created on my own. So far I have completed the html boilerplate setup, how to do paragraphs and headings, create ordered and unordered lists, italiics, bold, and also how to create tables and forms. For this odin-recipes project I will be creating a blog-like webpage that will consist of various recipes and steps.
